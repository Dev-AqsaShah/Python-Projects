# oop in python 
# to map with real world scenarios, we started using objects in code. this is called object oriented programming.

# class & object in python
# class is a blueprint for creating objects.

# class Student:
#     name = "aqsa shah"
    
    
# s1 = Student()
# print(s1.name)

# s2 = Student()
# print(s2.name)



# __init__ function
# constructor
# all classes have a finction called _init_(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

# class Student:
    
#     def __init__(self, fullname):
#         self.name = fullname
#         print("adding new student in Database.")

# s1 = Student("aqsa")
# print(s1.name)
